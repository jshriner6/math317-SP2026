    <title>Portfolio</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your final portfolio entries for each chapter should be a professional-looking product that demonstrates significant 
        effort in arriving at solutions, and thoughtfulness in how that solution is organized and presented. While collaboration
        with your peers is allowed and encouraged, your final write-up should be done individually without consulting others. Therefore, 
        your final solutions should not closely resemble someone else's, or a solution that is on the internet or in a book. Refer to 
        <url href="https://jshriner6.github.io/math317-SP2026/syllabus/syllabus.html#sec-policies-10">the syllabus statement on Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</url>
        for how we will handle cases of academic dishonesty.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are encouraged (but not required) to use a typesetting application (like <url href="https://www.overleaf.com/project"><latex/></url> or <url href="https://pretextbook.org/"><pretext/></url>) for your final versions of your 
        portfolio. If you do not use one of these applications, please hand-write your submissions. Below we provide templates that can be copied of the questions that should be included from each chapter. 
        Questions will be added to these templates
        as we cover them in class, so the current version of a template may not contain every question that will be assigned for a given chapter.
        We are providing templates in <latex/>, but please reach out if you plan to use <pretext/>; we are also happy to help support that as well.
