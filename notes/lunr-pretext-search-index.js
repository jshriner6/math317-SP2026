A number is odd if there exists an integer such that .     For each proof, identify (with explanation)   the good (is anything done well?),    the bad (is anything mathematically incorrect?),    the ugly (is anything difficult to read\/follow?).             Note       Since the last equality is known to be true, the first equality must also be true.         The sum of two even integers is even.    Let , .   , which is even.         Let . If , then .    Let and . Then clearly .         The square of an odd integer is also odd.    Let be an odd integer. Then for some integer , , which is odd.         Every constant function is a continuous function.    Let be the constant function . Then is a horizontal line at , which can be sketched without picking up your pencil.
