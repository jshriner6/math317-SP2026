A number is odd if there exists an integer such that .     For each proof, identify (with explanation)   the good (is anything done well?),    the bad (is anything mathematically incorrect?),    the ugly (is anything difficult to read\/follow?).             Note       Since the last equality is known to be true, the first equality must also be true.         The sum of two even integers is even.    Let , .   , which is even.         Let . If , then .
